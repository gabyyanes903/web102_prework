MonsterFund is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 12 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [X] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [X] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [X] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

I ran into challenges with dynamically filtering and updating the game list, and adding new features like the search bar and nav bar links without breaking the design.
